      === Future Monthly Return Bound (Monitoring) ===
      Lower Bound (monthly, 99% confidence): -1.29621900%    [Block length L = 4]
      What this means: With about 99% confidence, any future month is expected to be no worse than -1.29621900%.
      How we estimated it: We used a block bootstrap with L = 4 to respect typical month-to-month dependence.
      We then looked at the 5th percentile of monthly returns and applied a BCa confidence interval.
      The number shown above is the **lower endpoint** of that interval (a conservative bound).
      Data used: 87 monthly returns  |  Bootstrap resamples: 25000  |  Confidence level: 99%
      Interpretation guide:
       • If this bound is well above 0%, downside months are usually mild.
       • If it’s near/below 0%, expect occasional negative months of that size.
       • Larger L assumes stronger serial dependence; smaller L assumes less.

      How we estimated it: We used a block bootstrap with L = 4 to respect typical month-to-month dependence.
      We then looked at the 5th percentile of monthly returns and applied a BCa confidence interval.
      The number shown above is the **lower endpoint** of that interval (a conservative bound).
      Data used: 87 monthly returns  |  Bootstrap resamples: 25000  |  Confidence level: 99%
      Interpretation guide:
       • If this bound is well above 0%, downside months are usually mild.
       • If it’s near/below 0%, expect occasional negative months of that size.
       • Larger L assumes stronger serial dependence; smaller L assumes less.

      Drawdown Analysis (BCa on q=95.00000000% percentile of max drawdown over 382 trades):
        Point estimate (q=95.00000000%ile): 6.26689100%
        Two-sided 95.00000000% CI for that percentile: [5.43219300%, 7.23515800%]
        95.00000000% one-sided upper bound: 7.23515800%  (i.e., with 95.00000000% confidence, the q=95.00000000%ile drawdown does not exceed this value)
