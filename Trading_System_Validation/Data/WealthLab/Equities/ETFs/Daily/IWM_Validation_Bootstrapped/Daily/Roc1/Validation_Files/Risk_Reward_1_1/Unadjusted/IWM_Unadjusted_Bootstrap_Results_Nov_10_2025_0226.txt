Filtering 504 surviving strategies by BCa performance...
Filter 1 (Statistical Viability): Annualized Lower Bound > 0
Filter 2 (Economic Significance): Annualized Lower Bound > (Annualized Cost Hurdle * 1.50000000)
Filter 3 (Risk-Adjusted Return): Annualized Lower Bound > (Risk-Free Rate + Risk Premium ( 0.05000000) )
  - Cost assumptions: $0 commission; slippage/spread per side uses configured floor and may be calibrated by OOS spreads when available.
  - Risk-Free Rate assumption: 3.00000000%.

      === Future Monthly Return Bound (Monitoring) ===
      Lower Bound (monthly, 95% confidence): -2.07218200%    [Block length L = 4]
      What this means: With about 95% confidence, any future month is expected to be no worse than -2.07218200%.
      How we estimated it: We used a block bootstrap with L = 4 to respect typical month-to-month dependence.
      We then looked at the 10th percentile of monthly returns and applied a BCa confidence interval.
      The number shown above is the **lower endpoint** of that interval (a conservative bound).
      Data used: 80 monthly returns  |  Bootstrap resamples: 25000  |  Confidence level: 95%
      Interpretation guide:
       • If this bound is well above 0%, downside months are usually mild.
       • If it’s near/below 0%, expect occasional negative months of that size.
       • Larger L assumes stronger serial dependence; smaller L assumes less.
