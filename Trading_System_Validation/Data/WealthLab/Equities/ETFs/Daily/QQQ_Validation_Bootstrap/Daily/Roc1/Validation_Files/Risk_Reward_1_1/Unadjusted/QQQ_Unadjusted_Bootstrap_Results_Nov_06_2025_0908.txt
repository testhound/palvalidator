Filtering 1008 surviving strategies by BCa performance...
Filter 1 (Statistical Viability): Annualized Lower Bound > 0
Filter 2 (Economic Significance): Annualized Lower Bound > (Annualized Cost Hurdle * 1.50000000)
Filter 3 (Risk-Adjusted Return): Annualized Lower Bound > (Risk-Free Rate + Risk Premium ( 0.05000000) )
  - Cost assumptions: $0 commission; slippage/spread per side uses configured floor and may be calibrated by OOS spreads when available.
  - Risk-Free Rate assumption: 3.00000000%.

      Lower Bound (monthly, 95% confidence): -2.48194600%    [Block length L = 4]
      What this means: With about 95% confidence, any future month is expected to be no worse than -2.48194600%.
      How we estimated it: We used a block bootstrap with L = 4 to respect typical month-to-month dependence.
      We then looked at the 10th percentile of monthly returns and applied a BCa confidence interval.
      The number shown above is the **lower endpoint** of that interval (a conservative bound).

       • If this bound is well above 0%, downside months are usually mild.
       • If it’s near/below 0%, expect occasional negative months of that size.

      We then looked at the 10th percentile of monthly returns and applied a BCa confidence interval.
      The number shown above is the **lower endpoint** of that interval (a conservative bound).
      Data used: 86 monthly returns  |  Bootstrap resamples: 25000  |  Confidence level: 95%
      Interpretation guide:
       • If this bound is well above 0%, downside months are usually mild.
       • If it’s near/below 0%, expect occasional negative months of that size.
       • Larger L assumes stronger serial dependence; smaller L assumes less.
      Losing-streak bound @ 95.00000000% CL: observed=3, upper bound=4 (trades)

      Annualized Lower Bound (GeoMean, compounded): 101.18056400%
      Annualized Lower Bound (Mean, compounded):    103.94147800%
      Required Return (max(cost,riskfree)): 16.54840700%

      Drawdown Analysis (BCa on q=95.00000000% percentile of max drawdown over 391 trades):
        Point estimate (q=95.00000000%ile): 10.06671400%
        Two-sided 95.00000000% CI for that percentile: [8.49698200%, 11.83802300%]
        95.00000000% one-sided upper bound: 11.83802300%  (i.e., with 95.00000000% confidence, the q=95.00000000%ile drawdown does not exceed this value)
