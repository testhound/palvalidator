      === Future Monthly Return Bound (Monitoring) ===
      Lower Bound (monthly, 99% confidence): -1.08081800%    [Block length L = 4]
      What this means: With about 99% confidence, any future month is expected to be no worse than -1.08081800%.
      How we estimated it: We used a block bootstrap with L = 4 to respect typical month-to-month dependence.
      We then looked at the 5th percentile of monthly returns and applied a BCa confidence interval.
      The number shown above is the **lower endpoint** of that interval (a conservative bound).
      Data used: 82 monthly returns  |  Bootstrap resamples: 25000  |  Confidence level: 99%
      Interpretation guide:
       • If this bound is well above 0%, downside months are usually mild.
       • If it’s near/below 0%, expect occasional negative months of that size.
       • Larger L assumes stronger serial dependence; smaller L assumes less.

      === Future Monthly Return Bound (Monitoring) ===
      Lower Bound (monthly, 99% confidence): -1.35202000%    [Block length L = 4]
      What this means: With about 99% confidence, any future month is expected to be no worse than -1.35202000%.
      How we estimated it: We used a block bootstrap with L = 4 to respect typical month-to-month dependence.
      We then looked at the 5th percentile of monthly returns and applied a BCa confidence interval.
      The number shown above is the **lower endpoint** of that interval (a conservative bound).
      Data used: 82 monthly returns  |  Bootstrap resamples: 25000  |  Confidence level: 99%
      Interpretation guide:
       • If this bound is well above 0%, downside months are usually mild.
       • If it’s near/below 0%, expect occasional negative months of that size.
       • Larger L assumes stronger serial dependence; smaller L assumes less.

      [Beginner's Guide to Standard Margin]
      • This is a standard stock/ETF. To maximize returns, we use 'Regulation T' leverage.
      • 'Reg T' allows you to hold $2 of stock for every $1 of cash you have.
        (e.g. If you have $10,000, you can hold $20,000 of positions).
      • You are borrowing the difference from your broker. This requires a 'Margin Account'.
      • You will pay a small amount of daily interest on the borrowed part, but
        for short-term trades (days), this cost is negligible compared to profit potential.
      --------------------------------------------------
      Costs assumed: $0 commission, 0.10% slippage/spread per side (≈0.20% round-trip).
