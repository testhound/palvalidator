      === Future Monthly Return Bound (Monitoring) ===
      Lower Bound (monthly, 99% confidence): -7.63845700%    [Block length L = 4]
      What this means: With about 99% confidence, any future month is expected to be no worse than -7.63845700%.
      How we estimated it: We used a block bootstrap with L = 4 to respect typical month-to-month dependence.
      We then looked at the 5th percentile of monthly returns and applied a BCa confidence interval.
      The number shown above is the **lower endpoint** of that interval (a conservative bound).
      Data used: 88 monthly returns  |  Bootstrap resamples: 25000  |  Confidence level: 99%
      Interpretation guide:
       • If this bound is well above 0%, downside months are usually mild.
       • If it’s near/below 0%, expect occasional negative months of that size.
       • Larger L assumes stronger serial dependence; smaller L assumes less.

      === Future Monthly Return Bound (Monitoring) ===
      Lower Bound (monthly, 99% confidence): -7.63845700%    [Block length L = 4]
      What this means: With about 99% confidence, any future month is expected to be no worse than -7.63845700%.
      How we estimated it: We used a block bootstrap with L = 4 to respect typical month-to-month dependence.
      We then looked at the 5th percentile of monthly returns and applied a BCa confidence interval.
      The number shown above is the **lower endpoint** of that interval (a conservative bound).
      Data used: 88 monthly returns  |  Bootstrap resamples: 25000  |  Confidence level: 99%
      Interpretation guide:
       • If this bound is well above 0%, downside months are usually mild.
       • If it’s near/below 0%, expect occasional negative months of that size.
       • Larger L assumes stronger serial dependence; smaller L assumes less.
