Filter 1 (Statistical Viability): Annualized Lower Bound > 0
Filter 2 (Economic Significance): Annualized Lower Bound > (Annualized Cost Hurdle * 1.50000000)
Filter 3 (Risk-Adjusted Return): Annualized Lower Bound > (Risk-Free Rate + Risk Premium ( 0.05000000) )
  - Cost assumptions: $0 commission; slippage/spread per side uses configured floor and may be calibrated by OOS spreads when available.
