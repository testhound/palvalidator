Filtering 426 surviving strategies by BCa performance...
Filter 1 (Statistical Viability): Annualized Lower Bound > 0
Filter 2 (Economic Significance): Annualized Lower Bound > (Annualized Cost Hurdle * 1.50000000)
Filter 3 (Risk-Adjusted Return): Annualized Lower Bound > (Risk-Free Rate + Risk Premium ( 0.05000000) )
  - Cost assumptions: $0 commission; slippage/spread per side uses configured floor and may be calibrated by OOS spreads when available.
  - Risk-Free Rate assumption: 3.00000000%.

   [ROBUST] L-sensitivity PASS (high variability relVar=0.40 > 0.25 but base LB comfortably above hurdle).
   [ROBUST] Split-sample SKIP (n=32 < 40)
   [ROBUST] Tail risk: q05=-2.67430100%, ES05=-3.04821300%, severe=yes, borderline=no
      • Tail-risk context: a 5% bad day (q05) is about 14.23× your conservative per-period edge; average of bad days (ES05) ≈ 16.22×.
        (Heuristic: flag 'severe' when q05 exceeds 3.00× the per-period GM lower bound.)
