Filtering 426 surviving strategies by BCa performance...
Filter 1 (Statistical Viability): Annualized Lower Bound > 0
Filter 2 (Economic Significance): Annualized Lower Bound > (Annualized Cost Hurdle * 1.50000000)
Filter 3 (Risk-Adjusted Return): Annualized Lower Bound > (Risk-Free Rate + Risk Premium ( 0.05000000) )
  - Cost assumptions: $0 commission; slippage/spread per side uses configured floor and may be calibrated by OOS spreads when available.
  - Risk-Free Rate assumption: 3.00000000%.

      Drawdown Analysis (BCa on q=95.00000000% percentile of max drawdown over 339 trades):
        Point estimate (q=95.00000000%ile): 17.90609900%
        Two-sided 95.00000000% CI for that percentile: [14.88266600%, 21.99203500%]
        95.00000000% one-sided upper bound: 21.99203500%  (i.e., with 95.00000000% confidence, the q=95.00000000%ile drawdown does not exceed this value)
